00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
This is the ultimate mid range bone of 2020-23.

00:04.000 --> 00:11.000
Diamond City 1080 chip, 6.7 inch 120 hertz, 10 bit OLED display, 50 megapixel primary camera

00:11.000 --> 00:17.520
with OIS, a 5000 milliampere battery, 67 watt fast charging and a good looking design.

00:17.520 --> 00:20.800
The Redmi Note 12 Pro has it all.

00:20.800 --> 00:25.480
And the fact that Xiaomi has not missed a headphone jack and an IR blaster here is just cherry

00:25.480 --> 00:26.480
on top.

00:26.480 --> 00:29.920
It's said that the Note 12 Pro is not for you if you game a lot.

00:29.920 --> 00:34.880
For that you'll be better off with phones like the Poco F4 or the Redmi K50i.

00:34.880 --> 01:04.720
But if you're looking for a balanced all-rounder for the price, you cannot go wrong with this one.
